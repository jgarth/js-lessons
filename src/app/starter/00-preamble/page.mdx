# Welcome!

## What is happening?

This is the Take2 starter course. Before the full course starts, this course
gives you and us a chance to see if this is right for you.

Learning something new can be overwhelming, so the course also contains tips and
techniques for you to get better at the skill of learning, and some inspiration
on how to manage your life around the course.

  While it's going to require hard work, you are here because we think you can do
  it!

## What happens after this course?

After you have successfully completed the starter course, there's a full course
spanning nine more months.

The full course will get you ready for a job interview as a React developer.
It's still <u>up to you</u> to secure a job &mdash; however, after applying
yourself and passing the full course you will have all the technical skills needed to
pass the interview!

## What are we doing first?

In the next four weeks, we will teach you everything you need to know in order
to create your first website: a blog to help showcase your skills, which will
ultimately help to you to get hired.

We will talk about:

- Setting up your computer for web development
- Communicating well with your class and the teachers
- Some of the "languages" with which websites are created: HTML, CSS, and Javascript

# When things get tough

What’s the last time you learned a new skill? It takes hard work and focus to learn well.
Sometimes things will go really well! Sometimes, things will take a bit to click. Things will
seem tough. What can you do to get through the tough times?

A big part of getting through difficult periods is knowing _why_ you want to do all that
difficult work. This exercise is designed to help you remember that when you need it most.

<Task title="Write down why you are here" className="my-6">

    Think about how your life would change if you succeeded and secured a tech job after the course.
    **Name three things** that might be different.

    Don't just say:

    "If I get a job after the course, all my problems will go away"

    &mdash; they won't! A good example could be:

    "If I get a job after the course, I'll have the money to provide for a family."

    **Write it down and send a copy to Andy**. When times are tough and you’re thinking 
    of quitting, look at what you wrote down.

</Task>

We'll give everyone an opportunity to share their reasons &mdash; you don't have to, but if you're
ready to share, you might find that others can be inspired by what you have to say.
